🛡️ Proctored Exam Attestations (Blockchain)

📌 Description
This project implements a Proctored Exam Attestation system on the blockchain.
Proctors issue session attestations (start, end, and incident logs) that are immutable, verifiable, and tamper-proof, ensuring exam integrity for universities, certification bodies, and recruiters.

The smart contract handles three main attestations:

start_session → Records student identity verification and exam start.

end_session → Confirms secure exam completion with end time and submission proof.

log_incident → Records any cheating attempt, disconnection, or suspicious activity.

🌍 Vision
The vision of this project is to digitize and secure exam supervision in a transparent and decentralized way.
By leveraging blockchain, exam sessions become tamper-proof, auditable, and verifiable on-chain, protecting both students and institutions.

🚀 Future Scope

Add role-based access for authorized proctors & institutions.

Support zero-knowledge proofs for privacy-preserving ID verification.

Integrate with AI-powered monitoring systems for automated incident detection.

Build a frontend dashboard for proctors, students, and universities.

Enable multi-exam support with scalable storage via IPFS.
